# LinkedIn-Profile-Scraper

A LinkedIn profile scraper built using Selenium. The scraper logs into LinkedIn, extracts profile information (such as intro, experience, education, certificates, etc.), and saves the results in JSON format.

## Requirements

Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Python 3.x**: You can download it [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- **Google Chrome Browser**: Used by Selenium to automate browser actions.
- **ChromeDriver**: Make sure the ChromeDriver version matches your Chrome browser version. [Download ChromeDriver](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads).
- **Selenium**: For browser automation.

## Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repository-link/scraper-linkedin-profile.git
cd scraper-linkedin-profile
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Ensure you have `pip` installed and run the following command to install the necessary packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> Note: If `requirements.txt` is not present, create it, containing at least `selenium`, `pymongo`, and `python-dotenv`.

### 3. Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the `environment/` folder with the following variables:

```bash
# .env
EMAIL=your_linkedin_email
PASSWORD=your_linkedin_password
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017  # MongoDB connection (optional)
MONGO_DB=linkedin_db                 # MongoDB database name (optional)
MONGO_COLLECTION=profiles            # MongoDB collection name (optional)
NUMBER_PROFILE_DISCOVERIES=5         # Number of profiles to scrape
TIMEOUT=10                           # Timeout for Selenium elements
TRIES=3                              # Retry attempts for failed operations
DELAY=2                              # Delay between retries
DB_PATH=./data/profile_list.db       # Path to SQLite database to track profiles
ROOT=./data/root_profiles.json       # Root profiles file path
```

### 4. Fill the `root_profiles.json`

Before running the scraper, fill `data/root_profiles.json` with the profiles you want to scrape. Example:

```json
[
    "https://www.linkedin.com/in/yourprofile/",
    "https://www.linkedin.com/in/anotherprofile/"
]
```

### 5. Start Chrome in Remote Debugging Mode

To enable Selenium to control Chrome with remote debugging, you'll need to start Chrome with the following command:

#### For **MacOS**:
```bash
/Applications/Google\ Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google\ Chrome --remote-debugging-port=9222 --user-data-dir="/tmp/chrome-debug"
```

#### For **Windows**:
```bash
"C:\Program Files\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe" --remote-debugging-port=9222 --user-data-dir="C:\Users\YourUsername\ChromeDebugSession"
```

Make sure to replace `your_username` or `YourUsername` with your actual username.

### 6. Loggin to your scraping linkedin account (Don't use main account)

After Chrome is running with remote debugging enabled, logging to your linkedin scraping account.

### 7. Running the Scraper

After Chrome is running with remote debugging enabled, run the main script to start scraping:

```bash
python main.py
```

### 8. Output

The scraped LinkedIn profiles will be saved in `data/scraped_profiles.json`. Each profile is saved one by one, ensuring that the script can recover from crashes without losing previously scraped data.

### 9. Logging

All logs related to the scraping process are stored in the `log/scraping.log` file. These logs are useful for debugging and tracking the progress of the scraper.
